In a previous course I used GitHub to create a CSS stylized personal webpage.  Through my personal interests, I have seen people with tech buisnesses use GitHub to manage the sales 
for their buisnesses.  

Personally, I would like use GitHub to build a databand and share Database files to allow other people to edit and view the information included.  It seems like a great way to collect special survey information, but I know that there are better platfroms that serve the same purpose.
